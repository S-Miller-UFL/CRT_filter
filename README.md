This matlab file is designed to test how various low and high pass filters distort an image for a CRT effect

To compile this:
Simply open the "filters.m" file in matlab.

Make sure "cat.jpg" is in the same directory.

Next, run the matlab file. A series of windows will pop up showing the impulse response, the frequency response
and the distorted images as a result of the filters.
